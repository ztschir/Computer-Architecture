1. A virtual address is the address used by the user programs to interect with memory locations, in the terms of JOS, this is also the logical address. The physical address is the address used to point to a specific place in memory. The two are mapped through a page directory, page table, and a page. The virtual address and CR3 give enough information to map these two values together.

2. - 10 bits.
   - 4 bits.
   - 12 bits
   - 256 bytes

3. The cause of page faults are that the operating system gets invoked when trying to access memory that's invalid in some way. This can be anything from trying to access something outside of a allocated page range or something that needs to be brought from the disk. The effects on a running process can be a seg fault or just a long access time. This just depends on whether the page fault throws an exception.

4. No, sometimes the data that is being fit in a page doesn't take up the whole space and thus an illegal memory access just gives garbage instead of a seg fault. 

5. 
	1. 3 frames - 10 page faults
      	   4 frames - 10 page faults

	2. LRU 3 frames - 10 PF
	   LRU 4 frames - 8 PF
	   Clock 3 frames - 10 PF
	   Clock 4 frames - 8 PF
	   Optimal 3 frames - 7 PF
	   Optimal 4 frames - 6 PF
	   
	   With the provided list virtual pages being accessed, these algorithms seem to not display the Belady's anomaly. They all decrease the number of pages faults as the frames increase.
