1. 1. fdt[0-3] open
   2. fdt[1,2] open
   3. fdt[1,2] open
   4. fdt[0,1,2] open
   5. fdt[0,2] open

   This looks like it reassigns a file descriptor 

2. I recognized all of these machines when running traceroute on http://www.london.gov.uk/:

   cs-gw.cs.utexas.edu 
   cs45k-cs65k-po1-p2p.aces.utexas.edu 
   noca9-n7k-vlan691-cs.gw.utexas.edu
   noca2-ten7-1-noca9-n7k.gw.utexas.edu
   nocb1-ten4-1-noca9-n7k.gw.utexas.edu

   I also noticed ISPs:
   
   aust-utnoc-core-ge-6-0-0-0.tx-bb.net
   dap-brdr-04.inet.qwest.net

   I didn't notice any cities besides austin

   When I ran it a second time, all of the domain names turned into ip addresses. 

3. Since there were no instructions as to what level of detail we need to go into, I'll just assume a top level aproach. A server needs to open a socket and wait for a connection. When a connection is made, the server responds and creates a new thread for the connection so it can handle multiple connections.

4. a is the fastest, by about 1000 microseconds from c.

5. A. Wrong level of abstraction, assuming everything works, high overhead, bad structuring. 
   B. I don't remember covering this in class (I couldn't find anything in my notes), but I looked online for RPC and system calls and found that there are difficulties with passing pointers around. Whole data objects need to be passed around for a system call on RPC.
